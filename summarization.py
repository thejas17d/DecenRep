                - NEVER repeat any sentence, phrase, or medical information between sections

                - Each paragraph within a section must be unique
                - If you find yourself repeating content, DELETE the repetition
                - Use HTML formatting: <p>, <h2>, <strong>, <em>

                DUPLICATION CHECK: Before finishing, scan your entire response:
                - Are any sentences repeated? DELETE them.
                - Are any medical facts mentioned twice? DELETE the duplication.
                - Does any section repeat information from another? REWRITE to be unique.
